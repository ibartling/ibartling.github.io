I aspire to be a front-end web developer, which is why I'm taking CNIT 132A. I like learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I can build websites. In my free time, I enjoy learning Japanese, biking in Golden Gate Park, and making matcha lattes.<h2>Keep Exploring My Site:</h2><ul><li><a href=assignments.html>My Assignments</a><li><a href=contact.html>Contact Me</a></ul><p>P.S.

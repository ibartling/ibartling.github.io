We will also demonstrate other CSS properties using this same content that will enhance the appearance of these two columns. Only this paragraph will have the content split in two columns. The following paragraph will be in a normal layout as it does not have the class twocol applied to it. Read the rest of the lecture to learn about the other CSS properties related to column-count and also about the inheritance feature of this CSS property. For this particular scenario, only the CSS property column-count could do it - we could not have used the grid or flexbox layout as there are no other element(s) as children of this paragraph to become grid or flex items.<p>This is another paragraph without the class twocol which means that this paragraph will not be split in two columns. This paragraph will be formatted according to a normal format given to paragraph elements by browsers.</main><footer><p>CNIT 132A class at CCSF</footer>
